// cairn-core: pluggable magic-link email sender.
//
// Default adapter is Cloudflare Email Service → Email Sending (transactional, arbitrary
// recipients) — distinct from Email Routing's recipient-restricted `EmailMessage` flow.
// It is reached through the same `send_email` binding (configured without a
// destination_address) but a different call shape: `binding.send({ to, from, ... })`.
// Resend can slot in behind the same `sendMagicLink` signature if needed.
