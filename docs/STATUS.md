# ecnordic.ski: Project Status

**Current state.** The directive render pipeline is live; all five static pages carry inline
container directives; the content style guard blocks AI tells in `src/content/**/*.md`. The
contact form runs on a SvelteKit remote function (`form()`, Pass 9). Public delivery and the admin
surface run on the cairn-cms engine at `^0.21.0`. See `docs/architecture.md`.

**cairn-cms 0.21 migration: DONE (2026-06-02).** ecnordic moved from `^0.10.0` to `^0.21.0` as a
completely idiomatic cairn site, across two plans. Plan A (the breaking floor) ported the adapter to
the `defineFields` schema contract, the seven directive components to the `build(ctx)` slot model, the
five directive pages to the slot syntax, dropped the site's second sanitize pass for the engine floor
(extended via `sanitizeSchema`), and adopted the idiomatic public surface (`createSiteIndexes`,
`createPublicRoutes`, `CairnHead`, the `*Response` helpers). Plan B added the content graph: the
committed manifest (`src/content/.cairn/index.json`) and its `verifyManifest` build backstop, the
`delete`/`rename` admin actions, and the welcome post's CrewLAB link converted to a `cairn:pages/crewlab`
token (the `/waiver` link stays absolute, since the waiver is a hand-built route, not a content page).
Zero URL movement (guarded by `url-inventory`), no rendered-body change. Gates green (`check` 0/0,
`npm test` 50 exit 0, `npm run build` exit 0). The migration doubled as the first cairn-cms DX audit:
findings in `docs/cairn-dx-findings.md`, filed as an engine backlog in
`cairn-cms/docs/dx-backlog-ecnordic-migration.md`. All commits sit on local `main`, not pushed (a push
deploys live).

**Immediate next: deploy and the live `/admin` smoke (human fast-follow).** A push to `main` deploys
ecnordic to production, so a human pushes when ready, then smoke-tests `/admin`: the delete and rename
actions and the editor link picker against the real Worker. Two build-time follow-ups are recorded as DX
findings and in `BACKLOG.md`: the dangling-token backstop is not fatal (the inherited
`prerender.handleHttpError: 'warn'` downgrades the prerender 500 to a warning), and the schema contract
dropped four validation rules the old validator enforced.

**Pass 9 (DEFER):** contact form on `form()`, verified on adapter-cloudflare; the API is
experimental, so keep contact as the proving ground (BACKLOG #13). **Pass 10 (open, not blocking):**
placeholder content on CrewLAB / Training / volunteers; waiver/payment-model conflict.

### Next starter prompt (deploy fast-follow, then Pass 10)

> The cairn-cms 0.21 migration is committed on local `main`, unpushed. When ready to ship, push to
> `main` (this deploys ecnordic live via GitHub Actions), then smoke-test `/admin` against the real
> Worker: create or edit a post, exercise delete and rename, and use the editor link picker. After
> the deploy is confirmed, Pass 10 (placeholder content on CrewLAB / Training / volunteers) is the
> next site-pass. Invoke `site-pass` to start. Standard pass-end checklist applies.

**Deploy:** Live at **https://ecnordic.ski**. Push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions (build + pagefind + wrangler deploy).
